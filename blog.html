			<h3>What is a set()?</h3>
			
			<small>Posted by Rahul on 12/24/2020</small>
			
			<p class = "post_content">A set is a special data type in Python.  More specifically, it is an unordered list of elements enclosed by <code>{}</code>.  
			A set cannot have duplicate elements and if it does only one will show.  In the following examples, I demostrated some common methods used 
			with set operations.  I used the <code>add</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>remove</code> and <code>discard</code> methods in the following examples.
			
			<div class = "code">
			<code>
			<br>s1 = {54, 67, 88, 88}
			</br>print(s1)  # {88, 67, 54}
			<br># to create an empty set, use set() not {}
			</br>s2 = set()
			<br>s2.add(23)
			</br>s2.add(34)
			<br>s2.add(53)
			</br>print(s2)  # {34, 53, 23} <-- not in the same order as they were added

			<br># not the case with lists
			</br>list_1 = []
			<br>list_1.append(23)
			</br>list_1.append(33)
			<br>print(list_1)  # [23, 33]

			</br>s3 = {5, 5, 8}
			<br>s2.update(s3, [10, 11, 2])
			</br><print(s2)  # {34, 2, 53, 5, 23, 8, 10, 11}; only one 5 got added in set s2

			<br># remove value of 5, but not 6 because 6 is not in s2
			</br>s2.remove(5)
			<br>print(s2)
			</br># s2.remove(6) # KeyError: 6
			<br>s2.discard(6)  # works just fine
			</br>print(s2)  # {34, 2, 53, 23, 8, 10, 11}

			<br>set_1 = {25, 2, 1}
			</br>set_2 = {25, 2, 99}
			<br>set_3 = {25, 2, 1, 99}
			</br>print(set_1.intersection(set_2, set_3))  # {25, 2} <-- common in all sets
			<br>print(set_1.symmetric_difference(set_1))  # {} no values in set_1 that are not in itself
			</br>print(set_1.symmetric_difference(set_2))  # 1 is not in set_2 and 99 is not in set_1

			<br># final note: the 'in' operator of Python 3 works faster with a set() than a list(), so
			</br># be sure to convert a list() into a set() first when doing a membership test.

			<h3>What is a deque()?</h3>
			
			<small>Posted by Rahul on 12/24/2020</small>
			<p class = "post_content">A <code>deque()</code> is another data structure in Python that closely resembles a list(),
			but also has it own distinct characteristics.  'Deque' is a short-form for a "double-ended-queue" and 
			the code below contains some common operations that one can perform on a <code>deque()</code> with methods as <code>append</code>, <code>extend</code>,
			<code>pop</code>, and <code>rotate</code>. <code>pop</code>, <code>append</code>, and <code>extend</code> also work with a list object in Python.  
			
			
			<div class ="code">
			<code>
			from collections import deque
			<br># deque is a double-ended-queue
			</br>d = deque()
			<br>d.append(1)
			</br>d.append(22)
			<br>d.append(334)  # deque([1,22,334])
			</br>print(d)
			<br>d.appendleft(334)  # add 334 to the leftMost side: deque([334,1,22,334])
			</br>print(d)
			<br>d.popleft()
			</br>print(d)  # and we're back to square one: deque([1,22,334])
			<br>d.extend([4, 5, 99])  # add all elements of list to right side of d
			</br>d.extendleft([4, 5, 55])  # add to the left of the d in this order: 55,5,4..
			<br>print(d)  # d([55, 5, 4, 1, 22, 334, 4, 5, 99])
			</br>d.rotate(-3)  # move everything in d 3 places to the left
			<br>print(d)  # deque([1, 22, 334, 4, 5, 99, 55, 5, 4])</br>

			<h3>What is JSON?</h3>
			
			<small>Posted by Rahul on 12/26/2020</small>
			<p class = "post_content">JSON stands for  JavaScript Object Notation.  
			It is a very common data format similar to what we put in text files.
			You do not need to get intimidated by the word "Javascript" in it
			because all programming languages these days are equipped with libraries that
			parse and generate JSON files.  In Python 3, the <code>jason</code> library comes with Python's standard library.  
			I have attached an example of what a json file looks like below.  
			<!--<br></br><input type='file' name='C:\Users\rahul\PycharmProjects\learningPython\people.json'>-->
			Looking at a first glance, a Python enthusiast like myself can recognize 
			some elements of Python that are embedded into this json file.  I see a dictionary inside which is a key <code>"people"</code> whose value is
			a list of dictionaries, although the format is syntatically similar to the code for creating two JavaScript objects.
			Now there are some simple tasks that we can do with this json file.  I can convert this json data into a python object and to do 
			that, I will use a context manager: <code>with open("people.json") as f:</code>.  What this statement does is that it opens <code>people.json</code>
			and then I can store its information in <var>data_1</var> as such:
			<div class ="code">
			<code>
			with open("people.json") as f:
				<br></br><b class = "whitespace">add a tab</b>data_1 = json.load(f)
			<br></br># json.load() - loads a file into a python obj
			<br></br># jason.loads() - loads a string into a python obj # same rule of thumb applies for jason.dump()/dumps(), but you have to open(fiename, 'w') as f: and not open 
			<br></br> # the file with 'r' as a second argument in the <code>with open</code> context manager.
			<br></br># which is used to copy exisiting json data or modified jason data and "dump" into a new file 
			
			<p>I can now treat <var>data_1</var> as a Python dictionary.</p>
			people_names = []  # will become ["John Smith","Jane Doe"] after the following execution
			<br></br>for d in data_1["people"]:
			<br></br><b class = "whitespace">add a tab</b>people_names.append(d["names"])
			<br></br># json.load() - loads a file into a python obj
			<br></br># jason.loads() - loads a string into a python obj # same rule of thumbe applies for jason.dump()/dumps()
			<br></br># which is used to copy existing json data or modified jason data and "dump" into a new file 
			</code>
			</div>
