        | Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer who loves turning ideas into code. I graduated
        | with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
        | My work focuses on web development, mobile apps, and machine learning. Outside of coding, 
        | you'll find me at the movies with friends, playing basketball, or hitting the gym.
